    abstract={Reaction networks are widely used as mechanistic models in systems biology to reveal principles of biological systems. Reactions are governed by kinetic laws that describe reaction rates. Selecting the appropriate kinetic laws is difficult for many modelers. There exist tools that attempt to find the correct kinetic laws based on annotations. Here, I developed annotation-independent technologies that assist modelers by focusing on finding kinetic laws commonly used for similar reactions.},

elaborate systems models, but the systems biology community needs
information standards if models are to be shared, evaluated and developed

Level 1, a free, open, XML-based format for representing biochemical
reaction networks.  SBML is a software-independent language for describing
models common to research in many areas of computational biology, including
cell signaling pathways, metabolic pathways, gene regulation, and others.Availability: The specification of SBML Level 1 is freely
